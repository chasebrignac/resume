		WeCook
                \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items 
		\item Directed DevOps team that successfully built and maintained using agile development practices on Amazon Web Services EC2 a website to regularly auto bill users, permit editing of chef appointments, and enable Chief Operating Officer to manage hundreds of appointments efficiently (tech team left when CEO would not pay already agreed upon compensation for their work)
		\item Wrote and used chef appointment DevOps Python script to automate the creation of chef appointment documents used by the organization which instructed the chefs on the address, names, time of appointment, location, phone number, how much of each ingredient to buy, what cooking tools to bring, and how to cook the food depending on which foods and how much the customer chooses for a specific appointment
		\item Informed the executive team of technology limitations and expectations to inform business decisions
		\item Started consumer facing website using JavaScript, Meteor, and Boostrap with user accounts, Stripe and Facebook integration, and features for presenting meals and nutrition to users as well as scheduling chef appointments (did not need to deploy because of an extremely cheap development team we later tapped)
                \item Obtained profit margins of 10-30\% on bulk food chef appointments
