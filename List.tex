\section{WORK \\ EXPERIENCE} 


	{\bfseries {\em Systems Engineer}}  \hfill  {\bfseries{\em September 2015-Present}}\\
		NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Earth Science Mission Operations Code 428\\
		under the supervision of Rich Lonigro, contracted by Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc
                \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
		\item Recognition and successful mitigation of the failure of spacecraft procedures using Integrated Test and Operations System (ITOS) Spacecraft Test and Operations Language (STOL)
		\item Improvement of spacecraft DevOps scripts in an agile dev environment to ensure 100\% uptime
		\item Improvement of transition DevOps shell script resulting in more efficient automated transition from Mission Operation Center (MOC) to backup Mission Operation Center for Landsat 8
		\item Improvement of regression testing DevOps shell script resulting in more efficient automated regression testing of Landsat 8 spacecraft Front End Processor in MOC
		\item Improvement of load checksums  DevOps shell script resulting in more efficient automated checking of the loads to be sent up to Landsat 8 spacecraft
		\item Earned Satellite Console Controller and Satellite Operations Controller certifications
		\item Achieved 100\% data capture rate, error free operation, and superb troubleshooting of Landsat 8
		\item Successful operations of Landsat 8 during rollout of refreshed Mission Operations Center hardware/software
		\item Successful transition from regular Landsat 8 operations to extended lights out operations relying on automated software more and operators less to save customers money
                \end{itemize}
	{\bfseries {\em Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer}}  \hfill  {\bfseries{\em October 2015-March 2016}}\\
		WeCook
                \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items 
		\item WeCook provides personal chefs to cook all of a customers meals on request via a web app
		\item Directed DevOps team that successfully built and maintained using agile development practices a website on Amazon Web Services EC2 (pay for what you use pricing, high availability, performance, deployment speed, and security were AWS pros) to regularly auto bill users, permit editing of chef appointments, and enable Chief Operating Officer to manage hundreds of appointments efficiently
		\item Created operations software in Python which increased time efficiency over 40x (it used to take about 20 mins to make a single chef appointment document with customer information, my software decreased that time to less than 30 seconds) and increased accuracy 10x (Our chefs used to find mistakes in about one in ten chef appointment sheets they were given, mostly due to errors in figuring out how much of each portion of ingredients to buy, my software decreased the number of errors found to only those errors caused by customers, which I approximated to be about one in a hundred). These numbers were approximated by asking chefs to report to us when they notice a chef appointment sheet error and by asking the COO how long it took to make chef appointment sheets before and after my operations software.
		\item Wrote and used chef appointment DevOps Python script to automate the creation of chef appointment documents used by the organization which instructed the chefs on the address, names, time of appointment, location, phone number, how much of each ingredient to buy, what cooking tools to bring, and how to cook the food depending on which foods and how much the customer chooses for a specific appointment
		\item Informed the executive team of technology limitations and expectations to inform business decisions
		\item Started consumer facing website using JavaScript, Meteor, and Boostrap with user accounts, Stripe and Facebook integration, and features for presenting meals and nutrition to users as well as scheduling chef appointments (did not need to deploy because of an extremely cheap experienced development team we later tapped)
                \item Enabled profit margins of 10-30\% on bulk food chef appointments
		\item Attained revenue growth from hundreds monthly in October to \$10k monthly in February
                \end{itemize}
	{\bfseries {\em Test Engineer}}  \hfill  {\bfseries{\em April 2014-September 2015}}\\
		NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Planetary Environments Laboratory Code 699\\
                under the supervision of Dr. Paul Mahaffy, contracted by ADNET Systems
                \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
                \item Contributed to testing Martian satellite MAVEN, and Martian rovers Curiosity and ExoMars
		\item Tested MicroPirani pressure sensor for ExoMars rover resulting in a well developed and tested solution for taking pressure on Mars
		\item Calibrated, operated, and provided analysis from the MAVEN Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) testbed and instrument, yielding useful science products
		\item In calibration of MAVEN Testbed we found the pressures that resulted in abundances of each specific element (for example He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, ect.) on our copy of the instrument on Earth and then used that to extrapolate the pressures of these gases on Mars based on the abundances given by the instrument for any particular mass
		\item Created Python scripts that trend MAVEN NGIMS testbed data and instrument sensitivity using the agile development method resulting in the confirmation that the MAVEN satellite's mass spectrometer and our testbed on the ground is working correctly and not degrading over the life of the mission
		\item Improved usability of MAVEN satellite and Curisoity rover front-end web portal that presents and allows manipulation of satellite engineering and science data to the engineers and scientists called XINA online in AngularJS
		\item Tested several samples in our replica of the Curiosity rover mass spectrometer suit Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) on earth to find their fingerprint and try to match them with results found on Mars
                \end{itemize}
